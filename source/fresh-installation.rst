Installation at a Beamline
==========================

New Beamline
------------

Install Services
++++++++++++++++

These are instructions are one-time setup for a new beamline. If you are
configuring a new machine at a beamline that already has the software installed
one at least one machine, skip to the next section.

1. On some dedicated server (the standard choice is ``*-ca1``) apply the puppet
   class that installs mongo 3.x some dedicated server and start the mongo
   daemon.

Create New IPython Profile
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At NSLS-II we use IPython profiles to run startup scripts for user convenience.

Profiles are stored in (or soft-linked) from ``~/.ipython`` in the user profile
of individual users or shared beamline accounts.

The standard profile is called "collection," and the startup scripts are
located in ``~/.ipython/profile_collection/startup/``.

If this beamline does not yet have an IPython profile for data collection
under version control, create one. Start IPython with this command, and
then exit.

    .. code-block:: bash

        ipython --profile=collection

    .. note::

        The official IPython documentation has more information on
        `IPython profiles <https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/intro.html#profiles>`_

The above command created new directores and some files under
``~/.ipython/profile_collection``. We add startup files by writing Python
scripts in the subdirectory ``startup/`` in this profile directory.

This is a example IPython profile startup file. Replace ``YOUR_HOST`` with the
server where the mongo daemon is running.

.. code-block:: python

    # Make ophyd listen to pyepics.
    from ophyd import setup_ophyd
    setup_ophyd()

    # Connect to metadatastore and filestore.
    from metadatastore.mds import MDS, MDSRO
    from filestore.fs import FileStoreRO
    from databroker import Broker
    mds_config = {'host': <YOUR HOST>,
                  'port': 27017,
                  'database': 'metadatastore-production-v1',
                  'timezone': 'US/Eastern'}
    fs_config = {'host': <YOUR HOST>,
                 'port': 27017,
                 'database': 'filestore-production-v1',
    mds = MDS(mds_config)
    mds_readonly = MDS(mds_config)
    fs_readonly = FileStoreRO(fs_config)
    db = Broker(mds_readonly, fs_readonly)

    # Subscribe metadatastore to documents.
    # If this is removed, data is not saved to metadatastore.
    from bluesky.global_state import gs
    gs.RE.subscribe('all', mds.insert)

    # Import matplotlib and put it in interactive mode.
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.ion()

    # Make plots update live while scans run.
    from bluesky.utils import install_qt_kicker
    install_qt_kicker()

    # Optional: set any metadata that rarely changes.
    # RE.md['beamline_id'] = 'YOUR_BEAMLINE_HERE'

    # convenience imports
    from ophyd.commands import *
    from bluesky.callbacks import *
    from bluesky.spec_api import *
    from bluesky.global_state import gs, abort, stop, resume
    from time import sleep
    import numpy as np

    RE = gs.RE  # convenience alias

    # Uncomment the following lines to turn on verbose messages for debugging.
    # import logging
    # ophyd.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    # logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

Create a Beamling GitHub Organization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Create a username on github.com if you don't have one. Create a new
   organization with the name NSLS-II-XXX where XXX is the three-letter
   beamline abbreviation (e.g., ISS). Create a new repository in this
   organization named ``profile_colletion``.

2. Make the new IPython profile a git repository.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/.ipython/profile_collection
    git init
    git add startup/
    git commmit -m "initial commit"
    

3. Upload the ``profile_collection`` git repository to GitHub. Be sure to edit
   the command below to replace NSLS-II-XXX with the name of your organization.

.. code-block:: bash

    git remote add https://github.com/NSLS-II-XXX/profile_collection.git
    git push -u origin master


Configure the Olog
++++++++++++++++++

Essential Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pyOlog requires a configuration file to specify the connection
settings. As root, create a file at ``/etc/pyOlog.conf`` with the following
contents.::

    [DEFAULT]
    url = https://<beamline>-log.cs.nsls2.local:8181/Olog
    logbooks = Commissioning   # use the name of an existing logbook
    username = <username>
    password = <password>

where ``<beamline>`` is the designation formatted like ``xf23id1``.

Integration with Bluesky
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bluesky automatically logs basic scan information at the start of a
scan. (All of this information is strictly a subset of what is
also stored in metadatastore -- this is just a convenience.)

Back in an IPython profile startup file, add::

    from functools import partial
    from pyOlog import SimpleOlogClient
    from bluesky.callbacks.olog import logbook_cb_factory

    # Set up the logbook. This configures bluesky's summaries of 
    # data acquisition (scan type, ID, etc.).

    LOGBOOKS = ['Data Acquisition']  # list of logbook names to publish to
    simple_olog_client = SimpleOlogClient()
    generic_logbook_func = simple_olog_client.log
    configured_logbook_func = partial(generic_logbook_func, logbooks=LOGBOOKS)

    cb = logbook_cb_factory(configured_logbook_func)
    RE.subscribe('start', cb)

Integration with Ophyd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ophyd has as ``log_pos`` method that writes the current position of all
positioners into the log. To enable this, add the following to an IPython
profile startup file, add::
    
    # This is for ophyd.commands.get_logbook, which simply looks for
    # a variable called 'logbook' in the global IPython namespace.
    logbook = simple_olog_client

The log entires will be written into the logbook specified in
``.pyOlog.conf`` (in our example, "Commissioning"), not the logbook
used by bluesky (in our example, "Data Acquisition").

Olog IPython "Magics"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"Magics" are special IPython commands (not part of Python itself). They
begin with %. There are two IPython magics for conveniently writing to
the Olog.

* Type ``%logit`` to quickly type a text log entry.
* Type ``%grabit``, select an area of the screen to capture, and type in a 
  text caption.

These require their own special configuration. In the profile directory, such
as ``~/.ipython/profile_collection``, edit the file ``ipython_config.py``.

Add the line::

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = ['pyOlog.cli.ipy']

The log entires will be written into the logbook specified in
``.pyOlog.conf`` (in our example, "Commissioning"), not the logbook
used by bluesky (in our example, "Data Acquisition").

New Workstation for Data Collection or Analysis
-----------------------------------------------

1. Verify that the conda puppet class has been applied by checking that the
   ``conda`` binary is available at ``/opt/conda/bin``. This should happen
   automatically on machines designated ``*-srv*`` ("server") or ``*-ws*``
   ("workstation") as soon as they are on the NSLS-II network and working with
   puppet.

2. Create configuration files for metadatastore and filestore. As root user,
   compose two new files:

.. code-block:: bash

    # /etc/metadatastore.yml
    host: hostname
    port: 27017
    database: metadatastore-production-v1
    timezone: US/Eastern

    # /etc/filestore.yml
    host: hostname
    port: 27017
    database: filestore-production-v1

New User
--------

1. Add the following to the user's ``~/.bashrc`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

    export http_proxy=http://proxy:8888
    export https_proxy=http://proxy:8888
    export no_proxy=cs.nsls2.local
    export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH

2. Install all the data collection software.

.. warning::

    The command below will change in the near future: ``lightsource2`` will
    revert back to the name ``nsls-tag``, which is it had been named until
    recently.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -c lightsource2-tag -n collection ophyd bluesky pyolog xray_vision

To test the new environment, activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

    source activate collection

3. Check that ``which ipython`` point to a path with the word ``collection`` it
   in (not ``/usr/bin/python``, as a counterexample). To troubleshoot, you
   might need to refresh bash with the command ``hash -r``.
