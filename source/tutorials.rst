Before You Go
+++++++++++++

* Bring a laptop.
* In most tutorails, we use conda, a package manager designed for scientific
  Python. It's OK if you haven't heard of it or used it before, but please
  `download and install it <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ in
  advance.
* Sign up for an account on `GitHub <https://github.com>`.

If you have difficulty with the installation, email a member of the DAMA group
or attend office hours (see below).
